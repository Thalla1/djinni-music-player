# DJinni Music Player

Mix sound effects and music with looping, fading, and more to provide an immersive experience!

**How it Works**

The DJinni Music Player allows the GM to curate Youtube links and play them for their players. You can mix music, monster noises, weather sounds, swords clashing, whatever you think makes the experience the most immersive!

Clicking the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgbergman/music-player/main/src/icon.svg" width=20 alt="DJinni Icon"> icon at the top of the page will open the DJinni Music Player.
By default, a few preloaded folders will open with some self-describing names. Open one of these folders by double-clicking on it.

At the top there is a header, with icons to open and save .djinni files. Whenever you load up Owlbear Rodeo, you will need to open your .djinni file. They are too big to store within Owlbear Rodeo as part of the extension.

There is an icon that toggles between 3 persons and 1 person. This means that you are either playing these sounds to all of your player's browsers, or just locally to your own. This toggle can be useful if you'd like to share your audio through a service like Zoom or Discord.

There is a volume slider along with a mute toggle. This is only local to your browser, and each player will have their own volume control slider on their browser.


Within each folder are the playable streams. To play a stream, click on it once. Clicking on it again will stop it. Once you play a stream, a pause and stop icon will appear in the header. Clicking the pause icon will pause all streams, and turn into a play icon, which allows you to resume them. Clicking the stop icon will end all streams immediately with no fade-outs.

To edit a stream, click its edit icon. Here you can change many things about the stream, like its icon, name, volume levels, etc.
The stream also has a fade-out option. When you click on the stream to end it, it will either end abruptly or you can choose to have it fade out from 1-10 seconds.

From this page, you can add/edit/delete links. 
For example, this stream has a few different sound effect links: waves, seagulls, and footsteps on sand. DJinni mixes these together to provide a "beach" sound effect. Each stream has a volume level, and each link has a volume level (relative to the other links within that stream). 
You can see that the waves are playing on a loop, but the seagulls and footsteps will loop with a slightly randomized delay in between each. This sounds more organic and won't just be the same repeating noises over and over. 


If you are having trouble hearing the streams, please be sure you are either using Firefox or Safari on a desktop computer, or follow the instructions here: *link to autoplay guide.*
There is currently no way to autoplay streams on mobile browsers due to policies enacted from by Apple (iOS) and Google (Android). You can still use DJinni as a control-center on mobile devices, but you won't hear any audio.
