# DJinni Music Player

Mix sound effects and music with looping, fading, and more to provide an immersive experience!

**How it Works**

The DJinni Music Player allows the GM to curate Youtube links and play them for their players. You can mix music, monster noises, weather sounds, swords clashing, whatever you think makes the experience the most immersive!

Clicking the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgbergman/music-player/main/src/icon.svg" width=20 alt="DJinni Icon"> icon at the top of the page will open the DJinni Music Player.
By default, a few preloaded folders will open with some self-describing names. Open one of these folders by double-clicking on it.

Within each folder are the playable streams. To play a stream, click on it once. Clicking on it again will stop it.

To edit a stream, click its edit icon. Here you can change many things about the stream, like its icon, name, volume levels, etc.

Most importantly, you can add/edit/delete links. This stream has a few different sound effects links: waves, seagulls, and footsteps on sand. DJinni mixes these together to provide a "beach" sound effect. Each stream has a volume level, and each stream link has a volume level (relative to the other links within that stream). 
The stream also has a fade-out option. When you click on the stream to end it, it will either end abruptly or you can choose to have it fade out from 1-10 seconds. 
You can see that the waves are always playing on a loop, but the seagulls and footsteps will loop with a slight delay in between each. This sounds more organic and won't just be the same repeating noises over and over.
