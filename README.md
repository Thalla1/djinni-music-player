Mix sound effects and music with a variety of effects to provide an immersive experience!

**How it Works**

Clicking the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgbergman/conditionmarkers/main/src/icon.svg" width=20 alt="Condition Marker Icon"> icon when selecting a character will display a popup with 16 icons.
These 16 icons can be clicked, which will display a transparent white overlay to indicate they are currently selected. Hovering over them will display their name.

There are 4 pages of icons, which you can cycle through by clicking the left and right arrows on either side of the icons.

![Page Left](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgbergman/conditionmarkers/main/docs/pageleft.jpg)


You can also filter the icons by typing their name in the filter box. Clearing this box will bring you back to the page you were on.

As you select multiple icons, they will display in a grid-like fashion over the selected character starting at the top left, with a minimum of 5 on a side.

If for any reason you need to move or edit the icon, you can double-click on it and unlock it like any other item in Owlbear Rodeo.
